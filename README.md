- 👋 Hi, I’m Liam.
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts really, I have an inquisitive mind so I love learning new things. I like to keep fit and love the feeling of solving a problem when I'm working on a challenging piece of code.
- 🌱 I've learnt a bit of Python and I'm currently learning Java - I'm keen to learn more about coding best practices and testing approaches like TDD.
- 💞️ I'm keen to learn so happy to collaborate on anything that might help me with my goal of becoming a software developer. 
- 📫 How to reach me - email me at ljcode21@gmail.com
