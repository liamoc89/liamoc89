- 👋 Hi, I’m Liam.
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts really, I have an inquisitive mind so I love learning new things. I love football and golf and spending time with my family.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning my first programming language, Python, and I'm loving every bit of it!
- 💞️ I’m new here so I'm not really looking to collaborate on anything in particular just now. My ultimate goal is to become a software developer so ideally, I would like to learn more about the github community, get to know 
     some new people here and find out about their route into their career as a software developer and hopefully learn from them in the process.
- 📫 How to reach me - email me at liamj.oc@gmail.com
